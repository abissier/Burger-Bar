### Description 

Burger Bar is a restaurant app that allows users to add the name of burgers they 
would like to eat. 

Once a new burger is entered, the burger will display on the left side of the screen
waiting to be eaten. 

Each burger has a button that allows users to Eat It! Once clicked, the burger will move
to the right side of the page. 

Each burger is stored in a database and is added or updated via POST, PUT, and GET
requests. The changes are then automatically rendered on the screen via express-handlebars. 

### Technologies Used
MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM.
