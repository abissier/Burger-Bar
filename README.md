### Description 
```
Burger Bar is a restaurant app that allows users to add the name of burgers they would like to eat. 

Once a new burger is entered, the app will display on the left side of the screen waiting to be eaten. 

Each burger has a button that allows users to Eat It! Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 

Each burger is stored in a databse and its eaten state is updated via POST, PUT, and GET requests. The changes are then automatically rendered on the screen via express-handlebars. 

```
### Technologies Used
MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM.
